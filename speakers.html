						<b>Talk:</b> The Most Important Minute of Your Life<br />
						<b>Synopsis:</b> <br />
						<p>
								There is a question you have answered several times a day, at least since your teens.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's the question you hear from everyone you meet, from all of nature.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's the question you ask yourself when you look in the mirror, or look down from a tall building.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's the question you'll ask yourself in the moment before you die.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your answer to this single question, so common you've probably never even noticed it, shapes everything about you, and determines your success.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is the most important minute of your life, and it is the doorway to your future.

						<b>Talk:</b> The Hustle<br />
						<b>Synopsis:</b> Many developers dream of working for themselves one day. However, when that day finally arrives, most developers find themselves ill prepared for reality. The moment you strike out on your own, you cease being a solely a developer or a programmer. You are now an indie, an entrepreneur, a freelancer, a contractor. While your programming skills might be the reason the business exists, "programmer" is only one of many jobs in your new business. No matter where your business falls in the spectrum between freelancer and product company, someone has to handle marketing, sales, business development, bookkeeping, accounting, and legal. Congratulations! These jobs are now all yours. Welcome to the hustle.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are interested in taking on all of these new roles (or you already have), you are not alone. In this session I'll share some of the principles, strategies, and tools that help me survive the daily hustle and have helped make it the most rewarding experience of my career.

						<div class="modal-body">
							<p>Jason's been coding up spiffiness and silliness for about fifteen years, working on such diverse projects as the throttle for a missile, a solid-state quantum computing simulator for electron waves in GaAs semiconductors, a Monte Carlo simulator for electron transport in nanostructure devices, generalized problem solving software using genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks, and a profanity-prone version of Eliza, an early A-Life expert system. He also wrote insane, down-to-the-metal microcontroller assembly language code for Octofungi, a robotic sculpture.</p>
							<p>
								In the Mac world, he's the primary author of ShapeShifter, Mighty Mouse, ThemePark, and heads the open-source Chicken of the VNC and Paranoid Android projects. He wrote most of the user interface for Quicken Essentials for Mac while sitting in a tent in the Sahara Desert. He ran the MyPublisher Macintosh software team, and he's also written proprietary solutions dealing with image compositing, Open Transport networking, and hardware interface controllers.
							</p>
							<p>
								He digs hiking, biking, art, martinis, cooking, loud music, and creating oddly euphonious phrases. He never wears shoes if he can help it and can dance like a mofo!

						<b>Talk:</b> Building a Backend for your iOS Application in Minutes<br />
						<b>Synopsis:</b> <br />When developing your iOS application, focusing on the primary features and overall user experience is where you most likely want to spend all your time.  You know Xcode like the back of your hand and can build Storyboards in your sleep.  Wouldn't it be nice to stick to what you know and create your backend using your frontend?<br /><br />  StackMob built its open source iOS SDK to make it easy to create your database on the fly and interact with all the server-side backend services. You can now create a database table in just two lines of Objective-C code. It enables you to save and fetch data or call your custom server side API in just minutes. We'll explore the implementation of StackMob’s open source iOS library and how it allows developers to integrate a robust backend into their iOS apps. You’ll leave the talk knowing how to build a backend service in minutes, not weeks.<br />
